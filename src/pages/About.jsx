      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm a passionate web developer with a strong interest in building modern, user-friendly web applications.
        I enjoy working with technologies like React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and have experience with backend tools like Node.js and MongoDB.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey started with a curiosity for how websites work, which led me to learn front-end development. Since then,
        Iâ€™ve worked on several personal and freelance projects that helped me sharpen my skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from coding, I love exploring new tech trends, solving problems, and continuously learning to stay ahead in this fast-paced industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in writing clean, efficient code and crafting smooth user experiences.
      </p>
